This is a simple UDP/IP client that
accepts datagrams which are simple
copies of each incoming DSC message,
from the main YaDDNet server.

These are appended to a simple text file
which is "rotated" each day.

The intention is to maintain an off-site
plain-text backup of all the DSC messages
fed to YaDDNet by the contributors for possible
restoration should the main SQL database be lost.
